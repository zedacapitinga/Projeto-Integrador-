Basic Animations & Sounds (audio is half the movie, so it’s pretty important for games too)
Lower Enemy HP (the game is about x, so don’t make x tedious)
Higher Rate of Fire (the game is about x so add more x)
More Enemies (more stuff to x at)
Bigger Bullets (more prominent x-related thing)
Muzzle Flash (accentuate doing x with flourishes)
Faster Bullets (find the funnest timing for x)
Less Accuracy (some chaos is fun, and it can affect how challenging x is)
Impact Effects (don’t let things simply disappear - show/imply what happens to them)
Hit Animation (let the player know that they’re doing x properly)
Enemy Knockback (allow the player to create “breathing room” by doing x properly)
Permanence (don’t let things simply disappear, also show progress from doing x) - corpos ficarem no mapa
Camera Lerp (câmeras mais suaves são menos irritantes e fazem com que o personagem se sinta mais em movimento)
Camera Position (make your camera setup focus on and enhance the experience of x) mouse e cam
Screen Shake (just do it, it’s fun & dynamic & easy)
Player Knockback [I think he means player recoil] (make the player experience x by how it affects their character & gameplay, also give players a reason to not always do x - because that’s why the player does it instead of it being automatic)
Sleep (add micro pauses to convey the drama of doing x well)  - pause menu
Gun Delay (make the character and its props look like they have weight/momentum when moving)
Gun Kick (add recoil to things that would have it - like firing guns)
Strafing (let the character/player be more dynamic by making sure the controls don’t constrain x)
More Permanence (it’s cool when little details don’t disappear, it also lets the player see where they’ve been and what they’ve done - it can create short-term nostalgia)
More Bass (sounds should have lots of depth and feel appropriate for the source, good audio can also raise player interest)
Super Machinegun (try ridiculous variations on how x works/performs, it makes the action more action-y)
Random Explosions! (explosions all the time can get boring, but who doesn’t like occasional, unpredictable ones? Warning: if they affect gameplay, you’ll need to balance the unpredictability)
More Enemies (because you added gameplay that makes it feel like there’s not enough to x at)
Even Higher Rate of Fire (because you added more stuff to x at)
Even Higher Rate of Camera Kick [Add Camera Kick] (make your screen shake direction/intensity work well for what’s causing it)
Bigger Explosions (seriously, who doesn’t like explosions? exaggerate them!)
Even More Permanence (you get the idea, just make sure things either don’t disappear, or show HOW they disappear)
Meaning (allow they player to win or lose, and guide them towards forming an opinion on what it means to do one or the other)
